        <p class="start">Now, let's start!</p>
        
        <h2 id="Lib">The Statue of Liberty</h2>
        <p class="liberty">The USA is home to several wonderful landmarks. One of the most iconic is the Statue of Liberty, standing tall on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. This colossal neoclassical sculpture, made of copper, was a gift from the people of France in 1886 to commemorate the centennial of American independence. The statue, standing at 305 feet (93 meters) from ground to torch tip, represents freedom and democracy. As you approach by ferry, you'll be struck by her grandeur and the historical significance she holds. Don’t forget to climb up to her crown for a breathtaking view of the harbor and the city skyline.</p>

        <p class="liberty">A symbol of hope and resilience, the Statue of Liberty has welcomed millions of immigrants arriving by sea, their hearts filled with dreams of a better life in America. It's more than just a statue; it’s a beacon of hope and a testament to human perseverance.</p>
      
        <h2 id="Falls">Niagara Falls</h2>
        <p class="Nigara--Falls">Niagara Falls, straddling the border between the United States and Canada, is a breathtaking natural wonder that leaves visitors in awe. Comprising three waterfalls—the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the Horseshoe Falls—Niagara Falls boasts an impressive average flow rate of over 85,000 cubic feet per second. The thundering sound of the water cascading down the cliffs, combined with the mist that rises from the impact, creates an almost surreal experience. Visitors can take boat tours to get up close and personal with the falls or enjoy panoramic views from observation towers and the Skylon Tower, which offers a bird's eye view of this magnificent natural spectacle.</p>

        <p class="Nigara--Falls">As one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, Niagara Falls attracts millions of visitors every year. Whether you're there to admire the sheer power of nature, enjoy the vibrant nightlife, or try your luck at the nearby casinos, Niagara Falls offers something for everyone.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Arch">The Gateway Arch</h2>
        <p class="Gateway-Arch">The Gateway Arch, located in St. Louis, Missouri, is an architectural marvel and a symbol of the westward expansion of the United States. Standing at 630 feet (192 meters), it is the tallest arch in the world and an iconic feature of the St. Louis skyline. Designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen and completed in 1965, the arch is made of stainless steel and has a sleek, modern design that contrasts beautifully with the historic surroundings. Visitors can take a tram ride to the top for stunning views of the city and the Mississippi River. The Gateway Arch is not just a monument; it's a gateway to understanding America's pioneering spirit and the journey towards new horizons.</p>
