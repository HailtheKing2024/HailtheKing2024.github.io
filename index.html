        <h2 id="Lib">The Statue of Liberty</h2>
        <p class="liberty">The USA is home to several wonderful landmarks. One of the most iconic is the Statue of Liberty, standing tall on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. This colossal neoclassical sculpture, made of copper, was a gift from the people of France in 1886 to commemorate the centennial of American independence. The statue, standing at 305 feet (93 meters) from ground to torch tip, represents freedom and democracy. As you approach by ferry, you'll be struck by her grandeur and the historical significance she holds. Don’t forget to climb up to her crown for a breathtaking view of the harbor and the city skyline.</p>

        <h2 id="Falls">Niagara Falls</h2>
        <p class="Nigara--Falls">Niagara Falls, straddling the border between the United States and Canada, is a breathtaking natural wonder that leaves visitors in awe. Comprising three waterfalls—the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the Horseshoe Falls—Niagara Falls boasts an impressive average flow rate of over 85,000 cubic feet per second. The thundering sound of the water cascading down the cliffs, combined with the mist that rises from the impact, creates an almost surreal experience. Visitors can take boat tours to get up close and personal with the falls or enjoy panoramic views from observation towers and the Skylon Tower, which offers a bird's eye view of this magnificent natural spectacle.</p>

        <h2 id = "Bridge"> The Golden Gate Bridge </h2>

        <p class = "Golden_Gate"> The Golden Gate Bridge, located in San Francisco, California, is a masterpiece of engineering and beauty. Spanning the Golden Gate Strait, the bridge connects the city of San Francisco to Marin County. This iconic suspension bridge, with its Art Deco design and striking "International Orange" color, enhances its visibility in the thick fog that often blankets the area. Completed in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest suspension bridge in the world at the time, with a main span of 4,200 feet (1,280 meters) and towers reaching 746 feet (227 meters) above the water. Walking or biking across the bridge offers breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay, the Pacific Ocean, and nearby landmarks such as Alcatraz Island and the Marin Headlands. The Golden Gate Bridge is not just a means of transportation; it symbolizes San Francisco and a testament to human ingenuity.</p>

Standing at 605 feet (184 meters) tall, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair and has since become a defining feature of the Seattle skyline. The tower's futuristic design, with its flying saucer-shaped observation deck, captures the imagination and offers a unique architectural marvel. Visitors can take an elevator ride to the top, where they can enjoy panoramic views of the city, the surrounding mountains, and the Puget Sound.
